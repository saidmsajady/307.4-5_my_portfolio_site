    <p>Scheduling Algorithms	                            								                    March  2024
        Implemented process scheduling algorithms including First-come, first-served (FCFS), Shortest-job-first (SJF), Priority scheduling, Round-robin (RR) scheduling, and Priority with Round-robin in C as part of an Operating Systems course project.
        C | Linux | Scheduling Algorithms | Linked List | Makefile
        •	Integrated seamlessly with the OSC textbook codebase, enhancing provided source code and Makefile for enhanced functionality.
        •	Developed sophisticated scheduling login in dedicated schedule.c files, surpassing stringent project requirements for each algorithm.
        •	Utilized linked list for streamlining task organization, implementing novel selection strategies tailored to each algorithm’s specifications.
        •	Calculated CPU utilization and implemented concise tables detailing Turn Around Time (TAT), Wait Time (WT), and Response Time (RT) for each task, showcasing a comprehensive understanding of the system performance.
        
        Multi-threaded Sudoku Validator 									  February 2024
        Designed and implemented a multi-threaded application in C for validating Sudoku puzzles of varying sizes and determining the completeness of puzzles with 0s.
        C | Linus | Multithreading | Sudoku Solution Validator 
        •	Developed a robust multi-threaded solution using Pthreads, employing eleven threads for checking columns, rows, and subgrids.
        •	Dynamically created threads, passing necessary parameters using a structured typedef struct.
        •	Implemented a seamless communication mechanism between parent and worker threads.
        •	Adapted the program to handle Sudoku puzzles of any size, incorporating command-line arguments for file input.
